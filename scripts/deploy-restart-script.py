"""
Deploy the canonical ktp-scheduled-restart.sh to every game host.

Safety model:
  - CONTENT GUARD, before anything touches the fleet: the canonical is
    gitignored and untracked, so `git status` can never flag drift in it and a
    deploy will otherwise ship whatever happens to be sitting there. The guard
    diffs it against the TRACKED `.example` and refuses unless the only
    differences are the values of allowlisted @hostinfo assignments. Per
    docs/runbooks/SCHEDULED_RESTART_LINEAGES.md the canonical (L2) is the
    `.example` (L3) with two placeholders filled, and that is the whole of its
    licence to differ. Drift runs BOTH ways — `.example` has been ahead.
    The allowlisted values are live Discord channel IDs in a public repo, so
    findings name keys and line numbers and never a value. Override with
    --override-example-guard "<reason>".
  - The canonical script is gitignored (it embeds the relay AUTH_SECRET), so
    there is no git baseline. Instead: fetch every host's deployed copy FIRST
    and require fleet consensus (all identical). The consensus md5 becomes the
    drift baseline; a host that disagrees with consensus is SKIPPED unless
    --force — never silently clobber an out-of-band-edited production script.
    A unified diff of consensus vs the new canonical is printed up front for
    eyeball review.
  - Timestamped backup (~/ktp-scheduled-restart.sh.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) before
    every overwrite; a failed backup skips the host.
  - The live script is never written in place (cron executes it at 03:00 ET):
    upload goes to a .tmp sibling, ALL verification runs against the .tmp, and
    only a passing .tmp is atomically posix_rename()d over the target. A failed
    post-swap re-check auto-restores the backup. Still: avoid running within
    ~10 minutes of 03:00 ET.
  - Verification: remote md5 == local md5, `bash -n` passes on the
    host, and the known tripwire greps (from root CLAUDE.md) still hit:
      'Checking for staged .new files'  == 1
      'addons/ktpamx/modules/\\*.new'    >= 2
      'created missing.*monitoring.lock' >= 1
      'ktp_extension_loaded'             >= 3   (R8 assert, added 2026-07-07)
      'stale socket_map_ entry'          >= 1   (socket-map sweep)
      'SOCKMAP_CONTROL'                  >= 2   (...and its positive control)
