"""Translate engine-side (Allies/Axis) team labels to report-team convention.

`ktp_match_players.team` is the roster slot a player held in the LAST half
they played (`scripts/in_game_result.py`'s own docstring: "report team 1 is
whichever stream slot played Allies in the terminal half"). Every box-score
and rating field in the internal report -- `players[].team`, `teams[].team`,
in-game result -- uses that convention. Three shadow pipelines do not:
`positional_shadow.py`'s `map_control` (from live `position_sample.team`),
`flag_swing.py`'s flag ownership (`owner_team`), and this repo's own
`progression.py` team-level series -- all fixed at engine side, 1 = Allies
/ 2 = Axis, for the whole match.

Because DoD swaps Allies/Axis at halftime, "report team 1" is GUARANTEED to
be the opposite engine side in half 1 of every two-half match. The two
conventions only agree in the terminal half. A curve or series carrying
engine-side labels under a `"team": 1/2` key that a consumer reasonably
reads as report-team convention (every other `"team"` field in the report
means that) is silently backwards in half 1 -- this was the actual bug
behind a reported "inverted momentum graph" (2026-09-20,
KTPInfrastructure workstream infra-half-side-correction).

This module is a TRANSLATION LAYER over `flag_swing.sides_by_half`, not a
second side-resolution algorithm: `report_team1_engine_side` is the only
place that decides which engine side report team 1 played each half, and
it is built directly on `sides_by_half`'s own per-(half, player) answer
plus the roster. A half `sides_by_half` cannot resolve (two sides in one
half, or no life-boundary rows at all) is a half nothing downstream can
correctly translate either -- every function here drops that half from
its output rather than guessing, matching the report's own "absence, not
zero" rule.
