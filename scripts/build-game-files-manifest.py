"""Build the KTPAntiCheat game-files integrity manifest.

Generates /opt/ktp-ac-api/game_files_manifest.json on the data server (and
locally for review). The manifest defines which game files the AC client
should hash + verify against expected SHA256s during session collection.

Three sources combined:
  1. .res files on the source server (maps/*.res — custom community map assets)
  2. KTPFileChecker ktp_file.ini (the engine consistency-check list the plugin
     actually loads: player models, player sounds — assets NOT referenced by
     any .res because they ship with stock DoD)
  3. Explicit additions (user policy: every stock held (p_) and world (w_)
     weapon model the game binaries load, the lowered/sprint _l set included,
     + grenade viewmodels at severity "review")

Excluded buckets (allowed modification): overviews/*, flag models
(w_aflag/gflag/wflag).

Every entry carries a `stock` flag: is this path in Steam depot 31, i.e. does a clean
install have it? Downstream that is what separates a player who deleted their footstep
sounds from one who has never played a given custom map — both report "missing" and only
one is worth an admin's time. The path list is checked in at
scripts/data/dod-depot31-stock-paths.txt.

First-person grenade viewmodels (v_grenade/v_mills/v_stick) were violations
from 2026-07-07, left the manifest entirely on 2026-09-13 when the operator
ruled them allowable, and came back the same day at severity "review" when that
ruling was revised: still never scored, but a modified copy is captured for an
admin again. Excluding them could not do that -- the client only hashes paths
the manifest lists, so an excluded path is unobservable, not merely forgiven. A
viewmodel is drawn only in the holder's own hands; p_ (held, seen by others) and
w_ (thrown) grenade models are a different bucket and stay enforced.

Skyboxes (gfx/env/*) were an excluded bucket until 2026-08-27. They are now IN
scope at severity "review" -- an operator POLICY REVERSAL, not a bug fix. A
skybox mismatch is reported and its bytes captured for an admin, but it does not
count toward a verdict. Reverting = move "gfx/env/" back to
EXCLUDED_PATH_PREFIXES.

Before writing, the run prints an advisory scope diff against the manifest already
at --out (or --baseline): which paths this regeneration adds and removes, grouped by
origin, and for .res-derived paths which maps referenced them. Scope is what the
client hashes, so an added path is more enforcement on every player and a removed one
is less. The diff is ADVISORY by default -- it prints and never refuses; --diff-limit controls
how much of a long list is spelled out.

--gate-scope arms a refusal on top of that same diff: enforced paths entering or leaving
scope must then be acknowledged by count (--accept-added N / --accept-removed N), or --out
is left untouched, the manifest is written to <out>.candidate, and the run exits 2. Either
--accept flag implies --gate-scope, so a count can never be handed to a gate that is not
running.

Usage:
  python3 build-game-files-manifest.py [--source-server <host>] [--out <path>]
                                       [--baseline <path>] [--diff-limit <n>]
                                       [--gate-scope] [--accept-added N] [--accept-removed N]

Defaults:
  --source-server  74.91.121.9 (ATL1 :27015)
  --out            ./game_files_manifest.json (relative to CWD)
  --baseline       whatever is at --out
  --diff-limit     10 paths per origin (0 = every path)
  --gate-scope     off; the diff prints and the run writes

Re-run after a known map deploy or weekly via cron. Manifest then SCP'd to
data server at /opt/ktp-ac-api/game_files_manifest.json; the API serves it
via /api/game-files-manifest with ETag-based caching.

Why the gate exists: source 1 is produced by an act with a different purpose and a
different owner. Running RESGen over a batch of maps is a FastDL deploy, and on
2026-09-15 one such run's output was read here as a manifest source and pulled 128 paths
into enforcement, at severity "violation", as a side effect. The gate is not a policy on
how wide the manifest should be; it is the missing reader on the join between the two
halves, for the runs where someone wants that reader armed.

# Every stock held (p_) and world (w_) weapon model the game loads, grouped by
# weapon. Each tuple: (family, [p_bases], [w_bases]); `.mdl` implicit. A family may

# world models (the dropped weapon and its projectile).
#
# 🔑 A name earns a place here by passing BOTH legs; one that fails either is a dead
# entry that reads as coverage:
#   1. the game binary loads it -- `strings` over dod/dlls/dod.so + dod/cl_dlls/client.so
#      names the literal path (the only format-string model path in either binary is
#      models/player/%s/%s.mdl, so a zero-hit name is a name nothing loads);
#   2. a stock client has it -- it is in Steam depot 31, the depot app 30 installs
#      (`DepotDownloader -app 90 -depot 31 -manifest-only`, anonymous).
# Presence on a server tree is NOT leg 2: the fleet install carries a community pack
# of extra p_*.mdl the engine never references. p_bar/p_mp44 sat here on exactly that
# mistake until 2026-09-15, reported missing by nearly every client scan while the
# real p_barbu/p_barbd/p_stg44 went unhashed. w_colt/w_luger/w_spade were the same
# bug on the w_ side: stock files, so never "missing", but pistols and melee cannot
# be dropped and no binary references them.
#
# The 2026-05-13 prune of "the _l/l pose variants" was half right. The no-underscore
# names (p_garandl, p_tommyl, ...) are community files; the underscore `_l` lowered/
# sprint held models are stock, loaded by the binary, and what opponents render while
# a player sprints. They carry the family's own severity. The community names are
# pinned out BY NAME in EXCLUDED_WEAPON_MODELS so "_l" is never read as a pattern.

# maps is a FastDL act -- it produces download lists -- and on 2026-09-15 one such run put
# 33 maps' worth of references on the source tree. The next regeneration read them as a
# manifest source and pulled the lot into enforcement, at severity "violation" by default,
# with nobody deciding that. Neither half was wrong; the join between them had no reader.
#
# The .res-producing side already prints its entry-list delta and refuses on a failed
# self-check (build_map_bundle.py). This is that same discipline on the side where the
# consequence lands on a player, for the runs that ask for it.
