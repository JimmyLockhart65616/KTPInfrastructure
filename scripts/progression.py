"""Progression: cumulative per-player series over each half, computed once.

The website's match page draws a kills-over-time chart (Leetify's per-player
timeline, translated to DoD). It must not derive that from the raw event
stream itself: a second consumer (the HUD, a post-match message, the clip
pipeline) would derive it separately and the two would disagree, which is the
divergence the HUD momentum work already measured. So the running totals are
built here, in the producer, and the DTO ships the points.

Five per-player metrics and one per-team metric, each a series per half:

  kills            frags with a producer clock where the killer is on the
                   other team (team kills and suicides do not count, matching
                   the box score's `kills`)
  deaths           every frag with a clock where the player is the victim
  damage           `damage_capped` dealt to the other team, from the per-hit
                   damage rows -- only when that source was captured
  cap_breaks       cap breaks with a producer clock (hlstats_Actions
                   code='cap_break', break_context correlated -- migrate_021
                   put the clock on hlstats_Events_PlayerActions itself, no
                   separate table)
  cap_participation  capture credits with a producer clock: reuses
                   credit_timeline, the per-credit rows
                   capture_credit_timeline_fact.sql already computes for
                   flag_swing's cap-credit join (±3s of wall clock against
                   ktp_flag_state_events) -- no second query here
  flag_differential (team)  flags held by team 1 minus flags held by team 2,
                   from the flag_swing timeline's flag events seeded with the
                   same spawn ownership flag_swing used, so the two agree on
                   what a half started as

The x-axis is the producer's game_time WITHIN the half -- each half is its own
map load and the clock restarts -- so every series begins at [0, 0] and halves
are separate panels downstream. No round index is invented; DoD has none.

Player ids stay in this (private) block; analytics_report_dto re-keys to names.
