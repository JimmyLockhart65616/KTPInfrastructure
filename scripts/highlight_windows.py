"""Key moments: the match's highlight windows, ranked by momentum swing.

A report stage over ``shadow_explorations.flag_swing.timeline``. Every kill
and flag event there already carries a momentum delta, so "what were the big
moments" is a clustering-and-ranking pass, not a new model. Nothing here reads
a demo or a position.

Consumers: the match report's key-moments section, the HLTV viewer's deep
links (a window's ``start`` in game time is what the anchor converts to demo
time), the post-match message's "best moment", and the clip pipeline. All of
them should read this block rather than re-derive it, or they drift.

Design, carried over from the ktp_highlights prototype (2026-09-08..17):

- Events within MERGE_GAP seconds join one window; a window's score is the sum
  of |delta| plus small bonuses for repeated killers and objective events.
- A window longer than MAX_LEN is centred on its peak-swing event rather than
  truncated from the start, which was cutting away the moment it was picked for.
- ``involved`` is capped at MAX_CAMERAS players ranked by how much of the
  window they drove (kills weighted above deaths). A busy sequence touches all
  twelve; rendering twelve angles for it is what turned a 20-minute render
  budget into two hours.
- Flag events in the timeline carry no player ids (capper attribution lives in
  capture_credits), so a window made only of flag events has an empty
  ``involved``. Consumers fall back to a director view for those.
- ``round`` rows (the engine clearing the map between rounds) are skipped:
  they are boundaries, not moments.
