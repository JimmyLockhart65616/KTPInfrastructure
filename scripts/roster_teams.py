"""Canonical report team per player, for rosters that change between halves.

`ktp_match_players.team` is the engine side a player held in the LAST half
they appeared in -- the daemon overwrites the row each half. Sides swap at
half time, so a player who leaves at the break and is replaced keeps his
half-1 side, which in the second half belongs to the OPPONENT. He is then
filed on the enemy's roster, his kills land in their totals, and the teams
come out 7-vs-6.

Measured on 1789952635-NY1 (2026-09-20, official): Las1K64 played half 1 for
`[ o_o ]` on side 2, subbed out at half, and the report put him on `uD`
alongside six opponents. Sixteen players across sixteen matches since
2026-08-31 carry the same defect -- every one of them a player who missed the
final half.

The fix reads the side groups out of the life boundaries, which are per-half
and authoritative, and maps each (half, side) onto a canonical team by how
much the two halves' player sets overlap. The final half's sides ARE the
canonical labels, so nothing moves except the players the roster got wrong:
`game_team` remains the side at match end (knowledge/KTPInfrastructure.md).
