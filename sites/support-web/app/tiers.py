"""Who sees what.

Tier resolution is pure and lives apart from the request layer so it can be
tested without a session, a database, or Discord. `main.py` supplies the two
allowlists and the signed-in snowflake; everything below is a function of those.

Deliberately allowlist-based rather than Discord guild roles. lan-web already
proves this pattern in production and it needs only the `identify` scope; guild
roles would add a bot token to an internet-facing app and a second consent
prompt, for about a dozen slow-changing admins. The trade is real and one-way:
an allowlist does NOT follow a Discord role change, so removing someone's admin
in Discord does not remove them here. Revocation is a deliberate act.
