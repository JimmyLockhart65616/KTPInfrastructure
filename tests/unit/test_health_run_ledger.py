"""ktp-data-server-health.sh: the check must be able to say it stopped running.

The 15-day silence of 2026-08-31..09-15 was not caused by a check that was
wrong. It was caused by a check that was *absent* — it exited before its own
report on every one-sided transition, posted nothing, saved nothing, and that
is byte-identical to a healthy estate. `#397` removed the line it died on. It
did not give the check a way to say it had died, and the next abort will be a
different line.

These tests pin the producer that says so, and every one of them is paired with
a control that makes the check stay silent, because a self-report that cannot
stay quiet is worth nothing.

`ledger_items` and `write_ledger` are extracted from the shipped script between
their `# >>>`/`# <<<` markers, so renaming or deleting either fails here rather
than silently testing a copy that no longer ships. The end-to-end tests run the
real script.
