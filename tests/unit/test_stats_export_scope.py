"""Offline tests for scripts/ktp-stats-export.py's scope and resend guard.

Two defects this covers, both seen in production on 2026-09-12: the 48-hour
window carried every match type, so pracc and 12-man play reached the site as
results; and nothing recorded what had been sent, so the same 26 matches were
re-POSTed every ten minutes for the endpoint to answer "unchanged".
