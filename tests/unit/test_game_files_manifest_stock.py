"""`stock` flag + dead-entry warning for `scripts/build-game-files-manifest.py`.

A manifest entry the client reports as "missing" means two completely different things
and the manifest could not tell them apart. `sound/player/pl_step1.wav` absent is a
player who deleted their own footsteps — silent movement, a real advantage. A custom
map's `.mdl` absent is a player who has not played that map. 99% of the corpus's 19k
missing-file occurrences are the second kind, which is exactly why the first kind was
invisible: 182 occurrences across 4 players sat inside that noise, unflagged.

`stock` is the discriminator, and it is a fact about Valve's depot rather than a
judgement about the player — which is why it lives in the manifest and not in a
threshold somewhere.

The dead-entry warning is the other half. `p_bar` and `p_mp44` sat in WEAPON_FAMILIES
for months naming files no client has: on the fleet tree via a community pack, so the
generator hashed them, and missing on 681 of 682 client scans. Nothing caught it,
because a manifest cannot tell "everyone is missing this" from "this file does not
exist". The stock list can.

Loaded by path with `paramiko` stubbed, the same way the scope guards next door do it.
